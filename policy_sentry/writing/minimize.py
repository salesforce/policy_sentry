Functions for Minimizing statements, heavily borrowed from policyuniverse.
https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/policyuniverse/

IAM Policies have character limits, which apply to individual policies, and there are also limits on the total
aggregate policy sizes. As such, it is not possible to use exhaustive list of explicit IAM actions.
To have granular control of specific IAM policies, we must use wildcards on IAM Actions, only in a programmatic manner.

This is typically performed by humans by reducing policies to s3:Get*, ec2:Describe*, and other approaches of the sort.

Netflix's PolicyUniverse has addressed this in their minimization code. We borrowed this logic from their code and modified it a bit to fit our needs.

Q: How many policies can I attach to an IAM role?
* For inline policies: You can add as many inline policies as you want to a user, role, or group, but
  the total aggregate policy size (the sum size of all inline policies) per entity cannot exceed the following limits:
  - User policy size cannot exceed 2,048 characters.
  - Role policy size cannot exceed 10,240 characters.
  - Group policy size cannot exceed 5,120 characters.
* For managed policies: You can add up to 10 managed policies to a user, role, or group.
* The size of each managed policy cannot exceed 6,144 characters.
