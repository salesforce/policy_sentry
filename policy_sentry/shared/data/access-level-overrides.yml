# Borrowed some of these from: https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/policyuniverse/blob/master/policyuniverse/tests/test_action_categories.py
# Note: Some of those are incorrect, especially those from line 78, where it assumes that actions prefixed with "Get" should not be at the "Write" access level. However, these actions should be considered at the write level, since some of them generate access tokens.


#### Related to credentials leakage

# Not including this; even though it could lead to credentials leakage, it isn't necessarily managing other's permissions?
