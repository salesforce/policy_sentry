Versioning
==========

We try to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as much as possible.

Version bumps
-------------

Just edit the `policy_sentry/bin/version.py` file and update the `__version__` variable:

```python
__version__ = '0.11.3'  # EDIT THIS
```

The `setup.py` file will automatically pick up the new version from that file for the package info. The `@click.version_option` decorator will also pick that up for the command line.
