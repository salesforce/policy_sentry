flow, our philosophy, the test suite, and issue tracking.

Before we get into the details: *We want your help. No, really.*

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute. What could you possibly offer a project like this one?

We assure you -- the little voice in your head is wrong. If you can write code
at all, you can contribute code to open source. Contributing to open source
projects is a fantastic way to advance one's coding skills. Writing perfect
code isn't the measure of a good developer (that would disqualify all of us!);
it's trying to create something, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve.

We've provided some clear Contribution Guidelines that you can read here.
The guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch
merged. By making expectations and process explicit, we hope it will make it
easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing
documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes,
that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)
