# Release Drafter

1. Every time a PR is merged, the draft release note is updated 
   to add a entry for this change
2. We have a github release-drafter action which automatically 
   does this after a PR is merged.
3. It also increments the release version if this is the first PR for a new release. 
   Note: This will only update the draft release note. We still have to bump 
   the version as per [versioning document](https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/blob/master/docs/contributing/versioning.md)
4. When we are ready to publish the release, we use the drafted 
   release note to do so.
5. Release drafter categorizes the changes in the release into Features, BugFixes, Maintenance, 
   Documentation categories as per the labels added to the PR


Adding labels to the PR:

- Contributors can add appropriate label 
  to the PR (feature, bugfix, documentation, maintenance etc.)
- If PR contributor does not have the permission, 
  Maintainers should add the label.
