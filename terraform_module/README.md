# terraform-aws-policy-sentry

Builds secure IAM Policies with resource constraints. For more information on Policy Sentry, see [the documentation](https://policy-sentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Prerequisites

* You must have Policy Sentry 0.10.0 installed beforehand and it must be executable from your `$PATH`. Follow the installation instructions [here](https://policy-sentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/installation.html)
  * This module currently requires Terraform 0.12.8

## Usage

### Example

* Install Terraform 0.12.8

```bash
# tfenv is a Terraform version manager
brew install tfenv
tfenv install 0.12.8
```

* Install Policy Sentry

```bash
brew tap salesforce/policy_sentry https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry
brew install policy_sentry
```

* Use the module as shown in [main.tf](./demo/main.tf):

```hcl
module "policy_sentry_demo" {
  source                              = "github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry.git?ref=master//terraform_module/"
  name                                = var.name
  read_access_level                   = var.read_access_level
  write_access_level                  = var.write_access_level
  list_access_level                   = var.list_access_level
  tagging_access_level                = var.tagging_access_level
  permissions_management_access_level = var.permissions_management_access_level
  wildcard_only_single_actions               = var.wildcard_only_actions
  minimize                            = var.minimize
}
```

Assuming you have your [variables.tf](./demo/variables.tf) file set properly (redacted from this README for readability), provide the following in your `terraform.tfvars` file.

* [terraform.tfvars](./demo/terraform.tfvars):

```hcl
name = "PolicySentryTest"

list_access_level = [
  "arn:aws:s3:::example-org",
]

read_access_level = [
  "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/shaq"
]

write_access_level = [
  "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/shaq"
]
```
